## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - RELATING TWO NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function.

---

### ALGORITHM
Start

Read a and b

If a > b, then:

Set max = a

Else:

Set max = b

Print "The greatest number is:", max

End



### PROGRAM

```
Max = lambda a, b : a if(a > b) else b
 
input1=int(input())
input2=int(input())
print("The greatest number is:",Max(input1,input2))

```

### RESULT
Thus the Python program to check the relation between two numbers — whether one number is greater than, equal to, or lesser than another — using a lambda function is successfully verified.
